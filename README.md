kisakone
========

Kisakone is Finnish Disc Golf Associations disc golf tournament management software.

Complete and separate fork from lekonna's SFL-disc-golf-engine. Kudos to previous maintainers.

NOTE: Clone this with

    git clone --recursive ...

to get the development environment into tools/development cloned for you! Otherwise, checkout tuminoid:kisakone-dev project on Github!


Bleeding edge version is at branch called 'next'. Master aims to be stable.
