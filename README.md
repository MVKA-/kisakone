Kisakone
========

Kisakone is Finnish Disc Golf Associations disc golf tournament management software.

Complete and separate fork from lekonna's SFL-disc-golf-engine. Kudos to previous maintainers.

NOTE: Clone this with

    git clone --recursive ...

to get the development environment into tools/development cloned for you! Otherwise, checkout https://github.com/tuminoid/kisakone-dev.git project on Github!

Bleeding edge version is at branch called `next`. `master` aims to be stable.
Releases are the ones you want to use for production.
