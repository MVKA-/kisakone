combine.sh
==========

This tool allows you to combine many player profiles into one
Primary purpose is to combine TD-created temporary users into later created official users.

```
Usage: ./combine.sh <player id which stays> <player id which is merged and then deleted>,<second id>,<third id>,...
```

Please use only if you know what you're doing. Take backups. May cause irreversible 
mess into your user db if wrong id's are used!
